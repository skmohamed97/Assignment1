Assignment 1

This is a program that manages writing multiple threads into a shared file. This program creates a semaphore and creates 7 threads that writes to a file called quote.txt

To compile and run this program, simply use the command "make run"

You may also compile this file with the command "gcc -o bots a1.c -pthread". To run it, use the command "./bots". 

a1.c - source code
a1.h - header file
quote.txt - output file for threads
makefile
README.md
bots - exec file

This program taught us a lot about how complex threading is and how semaphores work
